Simply put, they customized the platform as per our needs, and provided a 24/7 support manager, something which we didn’t get elsewhere, and their Agent Assist, Co-Pilot and Customer 360 features were perfectly suited to enhance our CX.\\n\\n### Anubhav Mehrotra\\n\\nVP-Customer Experience\\n\\n**Tata 1MG**\\n\\n![Image 1](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20424%20739'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nOver the past 3 years, Kapture CX has really helped us stand out with better CX. We are using Kapture to improve our response time for warranty claims and a few other high-impact service requests by 60%. Kapture CX has been nothing short of inspirational.\\n\\n### Stanley Black & Decker\\n\\n![Image 1](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20422%20740'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nMy rating for Kapture would be a 10, for what it brings to the table in terms of data points, its strong support system, and the people I interact with are incredibly humble and sweet, which makes a real difference. If I had to describe my experience with Kapture in one word, it would be reliable. In fact, I’d say outstandingly reliable!\\n\\n### Rajiv Ravindran\\n\\nHead-Customer Success\\n\\n**Namma Yatri**\\n\\n## Witness the next level of customer experience with Kapture CX\\n\\nJoin the

      "This\n",

      "Tab Key\n",

      "Specifically, the scanner ignores the leading zero in the barcode, causing a mismatch between the scanned code and the EAN stored in Sendcloud.\n",

      "Solution:\n",
      " Update the scanner configuration to enable support for UPC-A barcodes, including leading zeros. Once this setting is enabled, the item scanning will function as expected.\n",

      "Tip:\n",
      " Always check the scanner configuration. Ensure that it supports the necessary barcode formats (e.g., EAN-13, UPC-A) and is set to send the Enter key after scanning. Some scanners default to sending the Tab key, which can cause Pack & Go to misinterpret the scan.\n",

      "International Commercial Terms\n",
      ", are globally recognized rules that outline the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international shipping. They clarify who handles transport, insurance, customs, and any risks involved, making it easier for businesses to understand their obligations in each transaction. By setting clear terms, Incoterms help prevent misunderstandings and keep global trade running smoothly. At Sendcloud, we primarily use two Incoterms:\n",
      "\n",
      "DAP (Delivered at Place)\n",
      ": The seller is responsible for delivering goods to an agreed-upon destination and covers all transport costs until arrival. However, the buyer is responsible for import duties, taxes, and unloading.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)\n",
      ": The seller manages all costs and responsibilities, including transport, customs clearance, and import duties, delivering the goods directly to the buyer’s location. This makes it easy for the buyer, as all costs are handled upfront. The Incoterm DDP is only available with a direct contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, all international shipments use the Incoterm \n",
      "DAP (Delivered at Place)\n",
      ", unless specified otherwise in the shipping method name. This means that the seller is responsible for shipping costs, insurance, and preparing export documents, while the recipient is responsible for any import duties. \n",
      "DAP\n",
      " is the most commonly used Incoterm for international shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, we offer a third option: \n",
      "DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid)\n",
      ". This means the seller delivers goods to the buyer’s location but doesn’t cover import duties, taxes, or customs fees. The buyer is responsible for these costs and manages customs clearance upon arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      ": If the recipient refuses to pay the import fees for a shipment, the package will be returned. Import costs will still apply (also in case of returns), and the sender will be invoiced accordingly.\n",

      "For example, the Sendcloud shipping API gives you access to the “Create a parcel” endpoint. You can make a call to this endpoint to create a parcel in the Sendcloud system by providing the endpoint with the information it requires (address information, shipping method information, etc). To make a request, you need to know which information our server needs in order to create the parcel.\n",

      "What are surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've enabled your direct debit and started shipping with Sendcloud, you will receive an invoice for your labels bi-monthly. It can happen that you notice a surcharge has been added to your invoice related to one of your shipments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      ": In some cases, surcharges may appear weeks or even months after the initial parcel was shipped, up to a maximum period of 7 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "A surcharge is an additional cost on top of the cost of your shipping label which is \n",
      "charged by the carrier\n",
      " when the parcel does not meet their terms and conditions. This cost is not affiliated with Sendcloud and the decision to charge this extra fee is in the hands of the shipping carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want some tips on avoiding unwanted surcharges in the future? Check our article: \n",
      "How can I prevent surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does a carrier charge surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "A carrier may choose to charge a surcharge when the package you are shipping does not meet their shipping conditions, and, as a result, extra costs are incurred during the process of delivering your package to its destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons for surcharges vary depending on the carrier or the particular shipping method, but can include everything from your parcel being the wrong dimensions, poor packaging conditions, the wrong shape for processing via a processing belt, too light or too heavy or because the wrong shipping method was chosen for the type of delivery or destination country. Some carriers even choose to charge surcharges for packages which have a \"Fragile\" sticker applied to the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything which results in additional or manual processing time on behalf of the carrier can result in an unwanted surcharge. That's why it's so important to always carefully read and be aware of the shipping conditions for your chosen shipping method.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the carrier measure and weigh your packages?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your package is picked up by a carrier or dropped off at a service point, its shipping journey begins. Your package will enter a manual sorting center where it is measured and weighed. If a package falls within the dimensions and weight restrictions and fits correctly on the sorting belt, it can be automatically processed and sorted for delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your packages are measured and weighed at two separate moments during the sorting process by highly accurate calibrated machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if my package falls outside the dimensions/weight?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a package falls outside the weight and dimension restrictions, or if the shape is too cumbersome or the packaging is insufficient for automatic processing, it must be removed from the automatic processing line and put to one side for manual processing. This adds additional time and labor costs for the carrier, which is why they will then charge you for these costs via a surcharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, it may happen that your package cannot be processed automatically due to the shape of your package and may even be returned to you without a delivery attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the surcharge calculated?\n",
      "\n",
      "A surcharge is always charged by a carrier after it has been processed. Only when the package arrives at the sorting center can it be measured and a decision made over whether the package can be automatically processed over the belt or not. These costs are calculated afterwards and as a result, you will find the surcharges later on your biweekly invoice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different carriers charge different rates of surcharges, and the type of surcharge incurred plus some additional factors, such as the weight of your package, will determine the price you pay.\n",
      "\n",

      ", are globally recognized rules that outline the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international shipping. They clarify who handles transport, insurance, customs, and any risks involved, making it easier for businesses to understand their obligations in each transaction. By setting clear terms, Incoterms help prevent misunderstandings and keep global trade running smoothly. At Sendcloud, we primarily use two Incoterms:\n",
      "\n",
      "DAP (Delivered at Place)\n",
      ": The seller is responsible for delivering goods to an agreed-upon destination and covers all transport costs until arrival. However, the buyer is responsible for import duties, taxes, and unloading.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)\n",
      ": The seller manages all costs and responsibilities, including transport, customs clearance, and import duties, delivering the goods directly to the buyer’s location. This makes it easy for the buyer, as all costs are handled upfront. The Incoterm DDP is only available with a direct contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, all international shipments use the Incoterm \n",
      "DAP (Delivered at Place)\n",
      ", unless specified otherwise in the shipping method name. This means that the seller is responsible for shipping costs, insurance, and preparing export documents, while the recipient is responsible for any import duties. \n",
      "DAP\n",
      " is the most commonly used Incoterm for international shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, we offer a third option: \n",
      "DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid)\n",
      ". This means the seller delivers goods to the buyer’s location but doesn’t cover import duties, taxes, or customs fees. The buyer is responsible for these costs and manages customs clearance upon arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      ": If the recipient refuses to pay the import fees for a shipment, the package will be returned. Import costs will still apply (also in case of returns), and the sender will be invoiced accordingly.\n",

This is the reason why surcharges are not applied at label creation, but will be invoiced afterwards on your Sendcloud invoice. You can receive these general surcharges when shipping with all DHL shipping methods. Therefore, please read this section carefully.

      "Package too light or too heavy\n",
      "\n",
      "Package falls outside the minimum or maximum dimensions\n",
      "\n",
      "The shape of the parcel means it cannot be processed automatically (such as tubes, L-shaped boxes, boxes stuck together, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Package has a \"fragile\" or \"breakable\" sticker on it to imply extra handling is required\n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery address is in a non-residential, remote or rural area\n",
      "\n",
      "The label cannot be read or must be relabeled due to incorrect address details\n",
      "\n",
      "Delivery time frame falls within peak season (Christmas period)\n",
      "\n",
      "Parcel is returned to sender\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I avoid them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip 1: Package your product properly\n",
      "\n",
      "Packaging your product properly for shipment does not only refer to correctly weighing and measuring the box. You should also ensure that the parcel is not packaged in an odd-shape (think cylindrical or multiple boxes attached together) because it will ultimately have to fit onto and travel upon an automatic processing belt when it reaches a sorting area. If a parcel does not fit or travel on the belt, it will be removed for manual sorting, and this is why you will receive a surcharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure you use robust packaging materials and that the contents of the box don't leak or slide around and that you don't ship any restricted products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip 2: Address and place your label correctly\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the benefits of shipping with Sendcloud is that the platform will detect missing address information. If an order in your Sendcloud platform is missing, for example, the postcode, then you will have to correct the issue before printing the label. Don't forget to stick the label horizontally on the longest side of the parcel so the barcode can be correctly picked up by the automatic barcode scanners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip 3: Select the correct shipping method\n",
      "\n",
      "You can receive a surcharge for using the wrong shipping method to deliver your parcel. For example, shipping with DHL Europlus (business network) instead of DHLForYou when the delivery address is to a private/residential location, or shipping a 25kg product with DHLForYou when the maximum weight is 20kg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be aware when shipping postal mail too - most carriers have specific methods for shipping postal mail or packages that are small enough to fit inside a letterbox. such as DHLForYou Letterbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip 4: Return to sender surcharges\n",
      "\n",
      "If a parcel is refused by a customer, not picked up from a drop-off location in time, or cannot be delivered due to a missing or incorrect address, you will be liable for paying the return fee when the parcel is sent back to the sender address. This is one of the most difficult surcharges to avoid, but you can install an \n",
      "address verification\n",
      " plugin to your webshop to prevent missing or incorrect address data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, integrating Sendcloud with your online checkout means you can offer varied and flexible delivery options including service point delivery to your customers. The more options they have for flexible shipping, such as Saturday and evening deliveries, the more likely that they will be home or available to receive their package.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip 5: Use shipping rules to avoid volumetric weight surcharges\n",
      "\n",
      "Most carriers charge a surcharge if the shipment surpasses the allowed volumetric weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "(I) If the order weight in kg is lower than the volumetric weight (for example volumetric weight is 6) then apply the first or a similar rule.\n",
      "\n",

      "What are surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've enabled your direct debit and started shipping with Sendcloud, you will receive an invoice for your labels bi-monthly. It can happen that you notice a surcharge has been added to your invoice related to one of your shipments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      ": In some cases, surcharges may appear weeks or even months after the initial parcel was shipped, up to a maximum period of 7 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "A surcharge is an additional cost on top of the cost of your shipping label which is \n",
      "charged by the carrier\n",
      " when the parcel does not meet their terms and conditions. This cost is not affiliated with Sendcloud and the decision to charge this extra fee is in the hands of the shipping carrier.\n",

      "Want some tips on avoiding unwanted surcharges in the future? Check our article: \n",
      "How can I prevent surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does a carrier charge surcharges?\n",
      "\n",
      "A carrier may choose to charge a surcharge when the package you are shipping does not meet their shipping conditions, and, as a result, extra costs are incurred during the process of delivering your package to its destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons for surcharges vary depending on the carrier or the particular shipping method, but can include everything from your parcel being the wrong dimensions, poor packaging conditions, the wrong shape for processing via a processing belt, too light or too heavy or because the wrong shipping method was chosen for the type of delivery or destination country. Some carriers even choose to charge surcharges for packages which have a \"Fragile\" sticker applied to the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything which results in additional or manual processing time on behalf of the carrier can result in an unwanted surcharge. That's why it's so important to always carefully read and be aware of the shipping conditions for your chosen shipping method.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the carrier measure and weigh your packages?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your package is picked up by a carrier or dropped off at a service point, its shipping journey begins. Your package will enter a manual sorting center where it is measured and weighed. If a package falls within the dimensions and weight restrictions and fits correctly on the sorting belt, it can be automatically processed and sorted for delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your packages are measured and weighed at two separate moments during the sorting process by highly accurate calibrated machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if my package falls outside the dimensions/weight?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a package falls outside the weight and dimension restrictions, or if the shape is too cumbersome or the packaging is insufficient for automatic processing, it must be removed from the automatic processing line and put to one side for manual processing. This adds additional time and labor costs for the carrier, which is why they will then charge you for these costs via a surcharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, it may happen that your package cannot be processed automatically due to the shape of your package and may even be returned to you without a delivery attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the surcharge calculated?\n",
      "\n",
      "A surcharge is always charged by a carrier after it has been processed. Only when the package arrives at the sorting center can it be measured and a decision made over whether the package can be automatically processed over the belt or not. These costs are calculated afterwards and as a result, you will find the surcharges later on your biweekly invoice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different carriers charge different rates of surcharges, and the type of surcharge incurred plus some additional factors, such as the weight of your package, will determine the price you pay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pack & Go is compatible with packing slips from external integrations, as long as the barcode corresponds with the order number as specified in the Incoming Order View in your Sendcloud panel. Please check if your integration supports plugins to generate order barcodes. \n",
      "This\n",
      " plugin, for example, can be purchased if you generate your packing slips from your Woocommerce integration. If you scan this barcode within Pack & Go, Sendcloud will recognize the order number and you can process your order without any problems.\n",

      "I activated the item packing feature, but when I scanned the items with my scanner, the items were not marked as packed. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure items are marked as packed, the scanner should send the \n",
      "Enter Key\n",
      " after each scan. Some scanners may default to sending the \n",
      "Tab Key\n",
      " instead, causing issues. Please consult your scanner's user manual, as the configuration varies depending on the brand.\n",

      "I activated scanner mode, but when I scan the order barcode with my scanner, the order doesn't open in Pack & Go. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "The scanner should send the Enter Key after each scan. Some scanners may default to sending the Tab Key instead, causing issues. Please consult your scanner's user manual, as the configuration varies depending on the brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is my item barcode not being recognized during item scanning in Pack & Go?\n",
      "\n",
      "This issue can occur if the \n",
      "barcode scanner is not properly configured\n",
      " to read certain barcode formats. It may happen that, although the EAN code is correctly configured in both the webshop and Sendcloud, the scanner fails to recognize product barcodes during item scanning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root cause is that the scanner is \n",
      "not set up to read UPC-A barcodes correctly\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, the scanner ignores the leading zero in the barcode, causing a mismatch between the scanned code and the EAN stored in Sendcloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      " Update the scanner configuration to enable support for UPC-A barcodes, including leading zeros. Once this setting is enabled, the item scanning will function as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip:\n",
      " Always check the scanner configuration. Ensure that it supports the necessary barcode formats (e.g., EAN-13, UPC-A) and is set to send the Enter key after scanning. Some scanners default to sending the Tab key, which can cause Pack & Go to misinterpret the scan.\n",

To retrieve data from an API, you make a “request” in a formatting language such as JSON or XML, or a programming language such as Python, to a server, and the server returns the requested data in a “response”. APIs are not merely a database—alongside requesting data, you can update, create and delete data by making API requests to specific endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Sendcloud shipping API gives you access to the “Create a parcel” endpoint. You can make a call to this endpoint to create a parcel in the Sendcloud system by providing the endpoint with the information it requires (address information, shipping method information, etc). To make a request, you need to know which information our server needs in order to create the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide example requests and responses, plus a list of required and optional fields which you can provide, in our \n",

      "Why use an API over a plug-and-play integration?\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers use APIs to build specific features into the existing custom-built webshop or system. Connecting to Sendcloud via the API allows you to customize our features to meet your business needs, plus you can integrate our features alongside third-party applications related to billing and warehouse management.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you integrate with Sendcloud through an API, you have full flexibility to decide how you want to build your order processing and logistics workflow. You can choose to process your orders directly via the API, or import orders into the Sendcloud panel and process them from there. Because our API gives you access to our key features individually, you can decide which features you want to take advantage of and incorporate them directly into your system and workflow.\n",
