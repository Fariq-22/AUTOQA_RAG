You can install the 0.0.20 version for the Python SDK or the 0.0.36 for the Node SDK.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3\\\\#setup)  Setup\\n\\nInstall our python dependencies, including langchain, groq, faiss, ollama, and firecrawl-py.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\npip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-community groq faiss-cpu ollama firecrawl-py\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe will be using Ollama for the embeddings, you can download Ollama [here](https://ollama.com/). But feel free to use any other embeddings you prefer.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3\\\\#load-website-with-firecrawl)  Load website with Firecrawl\\n\\nTo be able to get all the data from a website and make sure it is in the cleanest format, we will use Firecrawl. Firecrawl integrates very easily with Langchain as a document loader.\\n\\nHere is how you can load a website with Firecrawl:\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import FireCrawlLoader  # Importing the FirecrawlLoader\\n\\nurl = \"https://firecrawl.dev\"\\nloader = FirecrawlLoader(\\n    api_key=\"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\", # Note: Replace \\'YOUR_API_KEY\\' with your actual FireCrawl API key\\n    url=url,  # Target URL to crawl\\n    mode=\"crawl\"  # Mode set to \\'crawl\\' to crawl all accessible subpages\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\n```\\n\\n## [\\u200b](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3\\\\#setup-the-vectorstore)  Setup the Vectorstore\\n\\nNext, we will setup the vectorstore. The vectorstore is a data structure that allows us to store and query embeddings. We will use the Ollama embeddings and the FAISS vectorstore.\\nWe split the documents into chunks of 1000 characters each, with a 200 character overlap. This is to ensure that the chunks are not too small and not too big - and that it can fit into the LLM model when we query it.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings\\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)\\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OllamaEmbeddings())\\n\\n```\\n\\n## [\\u200b](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3\\\\#retrieval-and-generation)  Retrieval and Generation\\n\\nNow that our documents are loaded and the vectorstore is setup, we can, based on user’s question, do a similarity search to retrieve the most relevant documents. That way we can use these documents to be fed to the LLM model.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nquestion = \"What is firecrawl?\"\\ndocs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query=question)\\n\\n```\\n\\n## [\\u200b](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3\\\\#generation)  Generation\\n\\nLast but not least, you can use the Groq to generate a response to a question based on the documents we have loaded.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom groq import Groq\\n\\nclient = Groq(\\n    api_key=\"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY\",\\n)\\n\\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n    model=\"llama3-8b-8192\",\\n    messages=[\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\n            \"role\": \"user\",\\\\\\n            \"content\": f\"You are a friendly assistant.

In fact, I’d say outstandingly reliable!\\n\\nRajiv Ravindran\\n\\nHead-Customer Success\\n\\nNamma Yatri\\n\\nWitness the next level of customer experience with Kapture CX\\n\\nJoin the 1000+ Enterprises who transformed their CX\\n\\nwhile reducing support costs.\\n\\nGet Demo\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nAI Voice Bots\\n\\nConversational AI Chatbots\\n\\nInstagram Chatbots\\n\\nWhatsApp Chatbots\\n\\nEmail Bots\\n\\nFacebook Chatbots\\n\\nBots by Kapture\\n\\nGenAI Knowledge Base\\n\\nOmnichannel Experience\\n\\nSmart Ticket Routing\\n\\nAgent Co-pilot\\n\\nAgent Assist\\n\\nAdvanced Ticketing\\n\\nFrontline\\n\\nAuto QA\\n\\nReports & Analytics\\n\\nLive Chat\\n\\nLMS\\n\\nCustomer 360\\n\\nIndustries\\n\\nBFSI\\n\\nRetail\\n\\nTravel\\n\\nDigital Native\\n\\nEnergy & Utilities\\n\\nConsumer Durables\\n\\nUse Cases\\n\\nHelpdesk Management System\\n\\nOmnichannel Contact Center\\n\\nInternal Ticketing\\n\\nAI Ticket Management System\\n\\nService Center Software\\n\\nCustomer Experience Platform\\n\\nEmail Ticketing System\\n\\nCompare\\n\\nZendesk vs Kapture\\n\\nSalesforce vs Kapture\\n\\nFreshdesk vs Kapture\\n\\nResources\\n\\nBlogs\\n\\nCase Studies\\n\\nKnowledge Hub\\n\\nIntegrations\\n\\nNewsroom\\n\\nTechbytes @ Kapture\\n\\nAPI Documentation\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPricing\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nTrust Center\\n\\nCompany\\n\\n+1(415) 319-8777 (USA)\\n \\n+1800-212-797979 (India)\\n \\n+62 821-1098-4343 (Indonesia)\\n \\nenquiries@kapture.cx\\n\\nCopyright © 2025 Kapture CX.\\n\\nTerms & Conditions\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nCookies\\n\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

You can install the 0.0.20 version for the Python SDK or the 0.0.36 for the Node SDK.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n  Setup\\n\\nInstall our python dependencies, including langchain, groq, faiss, ollama, and firecrawl-py.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\npip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-community groq faiss-cpu ollama firecrawl-py\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe will be using Ollama for the embeddings, you can download Ollama \\nhere\\n. But feel free to use any other embeddings you prefer.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n  Load website with Firecrawl\\n\\nTo be able to get all the data from a website and make sure it is in the cleanest format, we will use Firecrawl. Firecrawl integrates very easily with Langchain as a document loader.\\n\\nHere is how you can load a website with Firecrawl:\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import FireCrawlLoader  # Importing the FirecrawlLoader\\n\\nurl = \"\\nloader = FirecrawlLoader(\\n    api_key=\"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\", # Note: Replace \\'YOUR_API_KEY\\' with your actual FireCrawl API key\\n    url=url,  # Target URL to crawl\\n    mode=\"crawl\"  # Mode set to \\'crawl\\' to crawl all accessible subpages\\n)\\ndocs = loader.load()\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\u200b\\n  Setup the Vectorstore\\n\\nNext, we will setup the vectorstore. The vectorstore is a data structure that allows us to store and query embeddings. We will use the Ollama embeddings and the FAISS vectorstore.\\nWe split the documents into chunks of 1000 characters each, with a 200 character overlap. This is to ensure that the chunks are not too small and not too big - and that it can fit into the LLM model when we query it.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings\\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\\n\\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)\\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\\nvectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OllamaEmbeddings())\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\u200b\\n  Retrieval and Generation\\n\\nNow that our documents are loaded and the vectorstore is setup, we can, based on user’s question, do a similarity search to retrieve the most relevant documents. That way we can use these documents to be fed to the LLM model.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nquestion = \"What is firecrawl?\"\\ndocs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query=question)\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\u200b\\n  Generation\\n\\nLast but not least, you can use the Groq to generate a response to a question based on the documents we have loaded.\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nAsk AI\\n\\n```\\nfrom groq import Groq\\n\\nclient = Groq(\\n    api_key=\"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY\",\\n)\\n\\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n    model=\"llama3-8b-8192\",\\n    messages=[\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\n            \"role\": \"user\",\\\\\\n            \"content\": f\"You are a friendly assistant.
